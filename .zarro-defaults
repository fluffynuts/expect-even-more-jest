# zarro defaults file:
# place one VARIABLE=VALUE per line below
# variables here will not override existing environment variables
#   unless prepended with a bang, ie
#     !VARIABLE=Value
#   so this means anything you set in your package.json, eg with
#   cross-env, will override what's in here unless you've specifically
#   marked the setting in here as forced with !
